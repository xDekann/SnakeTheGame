# SnakeTheGame
## Basic info
Snake game project written in Java with the help of JavaFX/CSS in Eclipse IDE.
## Usage
Just download and run the .jar file. It is going to create a directory for user score related files in the same directory in which it is being placed.
## More info
Directory "snakefx" contains the game copied to another new Maven Eclipse project. At the very beginning, I did not want to use Maven, so it is there purely for .jar generation purposes with a bit changed file handling (for saving user's score / css). If you want to run it in IDE, do not use the contents of snakefx. 
Javafx-sdk-17.0.2 has been used. Download/Installation -> https://openjfx.io/
The game itself has it's beginning in 'MainGame" class, where beginning Menu is being initialized, and from here we can access the "SnakeGame" initGame method, which initializes the whole game and connects components (boards/menus).
